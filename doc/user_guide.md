## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How accurate is the dream content generation?**
A: The platform captures patterns from your brain activity during REM sleep and transforms them into creative content. While not a literal translation of dreams, the system aims to reflect the emotional tone, imagery patterns, and thematic elements present in your neural activity.

**Q: Can I use the platform if I don't remember my dreams?**
A: Absolutely! The platform works with your brain's electrical activity during sleep, not your conscious dream recall. Many users report that using the platform actually improves their dream recall over time.

**Q: Is my sleep data being shared with others?**
A: Your sleep data is private by default. You control exactly what is shared. You can opt into anonymized research contribution, but this is entirely optional and can be revoked at any time.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How much REM sleep is needed for good results?**
A: We recommend at least 15-20 minutes of REM sleep for optimal content generation. Most adults experience 90-120 minutes of REM sleep per night across multiple cycles.

**Q: Can I use my own EEG device?**
A: The platform supports standard EEG data formats (.edf, .bdf). While our recommended devices are optimized for the platform, many consumer EEG devices can be used with varying results.

**Q: How are royalties paid from secondary sales?**
A: Royalties are automatically distributed through smart contracts when your NFT creations are resold. The percentage you set (up to 10%) is enforced by the blockchain contract.

### Content Questions

**Q: Who owns the generated content?**
A: You retain full ownership of all content generated from your dream data. The platform provides the tools, but you own the results.

**Q: Can I use my dream content commercially?**
A: Yes, you can use your dream content for commercial purposes. When you mint an NFT, you can specify licensing terms for the buyer.

**Q: Can I request specific themes or styles?**
A: The generation process primarily works with your dream data, but you can influence the style and aesthetic through the customization options. The core content will still reflect your unique dream patterns.
