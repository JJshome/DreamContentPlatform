## Overview

The Dream Content Platform is a groundbreaking system that bridges the gap between the subconscious mind and creative expression. By capturing high-resolution biometric data during sleep, the platform employs cutting-edge AI algorithms to analyze dreams and transform them into various forms of digital content, which can then be securely traded on a blockchain-powered marketplace.

This innovative approach opens up an entirely new dimension of creativity, tapping into the vast potential of the unconscious mind and enabling users to unlock, visualize, and monetize their dreams in ways that were previously impossible.

## Key Features
